    <h2>Thrustmaster T150 Racing Wheel</h2>
    <p>The thrustmaster T150 Racing Wheel is an add on to your PS4/Xbox One/PC, it is used to increase the realism within your racing simulation games. <br>
        It comes with force feedback due to the two motors within the wheel making the experance feel real, it also makes rthe wheel feel heavy like a real cars wheel.</p>

    <p>One bad ponit is thr pedals that you get with the wheel, these are made of plastic and feel rather cheep, so I would recomned getting an additional pedal set such as the thrustmaster T3PA set</p>
